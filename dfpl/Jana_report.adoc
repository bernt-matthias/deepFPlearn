= REPORT 15/11

== DeepFPlearn- Integration of CMPNN and DMPNN

* TrainGnn and predictGnn completed
  - Json args cannot be parsed
  - Have to add documentation cause every model requires different args
* Split_type fixed
  - A new dataset (x,y) is created for each target. With scaffold that takes time. ca. 12s/target. Is there a more efficient way?
* Shutil.copy produces an error if dest file is not there
* DBN runs but autoencoder not

== DL in pred tox: A review

* Updated table for data sources and sorted them
* Updated table for tool availability
* Wrote a bridging paragraph for ML/DL
* Currently updating the molecular representation paragraph
* After that, I will dive into the methods.

== Department seminar

* I will discuss several pretraining strategies and highlight the pros and cons of each one
* After completing the dfpl current tasks, a pretraining strategy should be integrated or reimplemented.


== Miscellaneous

* Side project with Daniel Zahn for predicting persistency of chemicals
    - Currently reading literature


== TODOs

* Zoom account
* Scaffold split note on readme
* Write logger for training and splitting
* Merge branch main to soulios for DL review
* Use jupyter for side project
* 1st of December of teaching
